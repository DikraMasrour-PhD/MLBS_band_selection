# Measurement Learning-based Band Selection (MLBS)

The repository for the source code of the MLBS algorithm for hyperspectral band selection.

The source_code address includes three .py files including training code for the proposed model MLBS and two alternative deep convolutional neural network-based band selection models BHCNN and CM-CNN. Another three .py file includes the codework for separating the band selection module of the models and testing them with an SVM classifier.

The codes for training work standalone. You may run any of them in a machine on the terminal or any IDE with Python as long as you keep them together in the same address with the dataset folder.
